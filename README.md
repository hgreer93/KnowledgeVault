/*
		When using multiple devices each resource will have an instance of FReplicatedResourceSet
		which is used to contain a series of FReplicatedResource instances.

		Replication can occur however the backing device wishes but, using a GPU->CPU replication for example,
		the following steps would occur

			A Texture exists on GPU memory, and wishes to be replicated to a CPU device.
			This will trigger a dynamic readback of the texture resource into CPU memory.

			CPUDevice->ReplicateResource(TextureResource);

			To check if the replication is ready

			FReplicatedResource* Replication;
			Replication->HasReplicated() -or- Replication->WaitForReplication();

			When command lists are submitted they are marked with a special flag which
			determines what hardware the command list will execute on. At this stage
			all resources referenced within the command list will check to ensure they have
			replication information on the executing device. If not, the resources are replicated
			and the command list will not be submitted until the replication is completed.

			This can be a potentially slow operation, so it is strongly recommended to create
			the replication information at the same time the resource is created.

	/*
		A hardware fence has a single ID3D12Fence object, but when a sync is required, it can be performed in two ways.

		1)	The sync is performed synchronously using FHardwareFence::SyncToThis or FHardwareFence::SyncToValue
			This will cause the caller to perform a hard CPU stall waiting for the fence.
			This is the primary mode of synchronization. When this is performed no FD3D12SyncPoint will be queued.

		2)	The sync is performed asynchronously using FHardwareFence::PerformAsyncSync
			This will not perform a hard CPU stall, but will queue a single FD3D12SyncPoint and return a SyncPointHandle which can be waited upon.

			Due to the asynchronous nature it may take a period of time for the callback to be performed (thus indicating a sync).
			The reason for this is sync point checks are only performed once per frame, and callbacks are sent via the job system.
			
			Therefore these are best used for things such as streaming background data which will not be needed for a period of time.
			If the data is needed before rendering can continue one option is to use the FHardwareDevice::WaitForSyncHandle, which will perform
			a hard CPU stall, or if the sync point was submitted using the EmitSignal flag it is possible to perform a GPU sync.

			The advantage of using the signal will be it becomes possible to start using data for rendering before the callback has occurred,
			but if the callback performs manipulation on that data a CPU stall is the only way.

			Therefore:

			EAsyncSyncPointFlags
			{
				None					= ( 0 ),		// The callback performs no manipulation of the data which would affect the data as it exists on the GPU.
				PerformsCpuManipulation = ( 1 << 0 ),	// The callback performs manipulation of the data, as it would exist on the GPU (i.e. Map).
				PerformsGpuManipulation	= ( 1 << 1 ),	// The callback will perform manipulation of the data using GPU command lists.
				EmitSignal				= ( 1 << 2 )	// A GPU signal should be emitted on the FHardwareEngine the fence was using or something...
			}

https://pcpartpicker.com/b/h6DxFT (search for NUMA)

I'm looking forward to the RTX-3070 & air-cooling with thermosiphons. IceGiant's TS is a rather tall cooler, but its reliability should be good & simplicity counts.

RTX-3070: FP32 20 TFLOPS, Tensors are an eye-watering 80 TFLOPS.

AMD’s Threadripper designs are essentially VLSI’s of dual-socket Ryzens, w/ the NUMA overheads optimized using an infinity fabric** & 64-lane PCIe. An Intel equivalent would be a pretty beefy pair of Xeons on an expensive socket.

** akin to the 12-cube interconnects of the Thinking Machine CM's ca 1992

The RTX-3000's can direct fetch from NVMe (previously only available on the latest Titan cards (Turing, Volta & Pascal )), cutting IO considerably even for accel. DBMS (see pg-strom, Greenplum, etc.).

	/*
		Notes for tomorrow:

		When using an upload buffer on a NUMA architecture, only MEMORY_POOL_L0 supports this,
		therefore it's easier to think that an upload buffer exists in RAM (not VRAM).

		An example of this is a GTX1070.

		AMD VEGA GPUs use UMA which means that the upload buffer could possible exist within VRAM (though, this isn't guaranteed).


		UMA
			There is only one physical memory pool shared by the GPU and CPU, example being an Xbox One, this means that
			only MEMORY_POOL_L0 is available.

		Most of the gaming desktop world though use NUMA architectures (except new AMD cards). In this case
		MEMORY_POOL_L0 is RAM and MEMORY_POOL_L1 is VRAM


		This means that using a heap type of CUSTOM allows for more flexible control over the heap configuration.
		The following guide only applies to NUMA architectures:

		D3D12_CPU_PAGE_PROPERTY_NOT_AVAILABLE
			L0 - Similar to HEAP_TYPE_DEFAULT, a GPU only RAM (nonsense for common usage cases).
			L1 - Similar to HEAP_TYPE_DEFAULT, GPU only VRAM

		D3D12_CPU_PAGE_PROPERTY_WRITE_COMBINE
			L0 - Similar to HEAP_TYPE_UPLOAD, uncached/inconsistent for CPU reading, but write operations are faster.
			L1 - Invalid, CPU can not access VRAM directly.

		D3D12_CPU_PAGE_PROPERTY_WRITE_BACK
			L0 - Similar to HEAP_TYPE_READBACK, GPU writes are cached, and CPU reading is consistent.
			L1 - Invalid, CPU can not access VRAM directly.

		Therefore, for NUMA architectures, a custom heap won't really provide any benefit. However, for better configuartion
		on all possible architectures, custom heaps are still a viable solution (especially considering AMD).

		Regardless, this opens the possibility where of using placed resources which are required to satisfy the
		requirements of our EResourceClassification system. This also means we will be maintaining the heap memory
		ourselves using a similar system as the core page allocator (essentially just blocks).

		However, not every heap type requires the same type of allocation strategies (Streaming heaps can use a ring buffer for example).

		So what we really need is something like a

		class D3D12HeapAllocator {

			// This returns the offset of the memory allocation within the heap.
			virtual uint64 GetAllocationOffset(uint32 TotalSizeInBytes) = 0;
		};
		
		class D3D12Heap {
			
			// Set the allocator which is used for this heap.
			D3D12Heap(D3D12HeapAllocator* Allocator);
		};

		Alternatively, we could just use a template for this (which saves us virtual calls).

		template <class UnderlyingAllocator>
		class D3D12Heap {
			uint64 GetAllocationOffset(uint64 SizeInBytes) {
				return UnderlyingAllocator::GetAllocationOffset(SizeInBytes);
			}
		}

		That system may be preferable since streaming memory will usually use a totally different heap..

How d3d12 command list generation will work and notes about submission and memory organization

We use a double pass approach where initially the game state will flip to 'read-only', and we begin building
our command lists via a parallel system. This works best where, for example, when rendering something such as 
shadows, the shadow map will need to know about the geometry which is visible. And again this must also occur
when doing things such as the main gbuffer generation, ect, ect.

This means that as tasks are queued, they will be split such that for shadow command lists, for example, we try
to have a single version of geometry which has been uploaded at once, but the requirement for geometry is split 
across multiple buckets/command lists. This is done to help reduce the amount of uploading which needs to occur.

This is where the two part-command list graph comes into play.. each 'pass' of the scene which have a corresponding
series of command lists, which have their own version of data.

Resources are then identified using one of two special handles:

SharedHandle -  The resource is shared between multiple buckets/passes, used to mark a dependency between passes on a
				per-resource level. A majority of resources which are shared go here.
				
GlobalHandle - 	The resource is shared between multiple frames, always goes into the main heap.
				Resources using this handle should be kept to a minimum as they do not benefit
				from the memory-purge system. To release they a call to Driver::ReleaseCriticalResource
				must occur.
				
Now, some things such as shadow casters can be merged with other command lists, meaning, each bucket should
contain multiple tiny command lists, which are then merged at the end into single large streams.

This means it's possible that you can split the buckets up on the C++ side, then on the GPU side 
be using the geometry for essentially a shadow-pass followed by GBufferGen pass. Doing it this way guarantees
that the data which is required will always be in memory (since we are aiming for command list bundles of 3-5 each).

However, there becomes a slight problem where some things may require a full shadow map in order to draw properly..
For example, a directional light source is required to have all the data. So perhaps what needs to happen is have
a system which has resource groups (basically the shared handle), but there must also be a requirement or something.



		// Create the per-thread memory page allocators. This is important because we want to ensure that we divide evenly the total size
		// for an upload heap, as well as a regular GPU only heap. These sizes are tuned to the logic of more threads = less memory per thread.
		// However, we will need to ensure that eventually we are combining at least 3 command lists to each 'execute command list' call, ideally..
		// But to make this occur we need to know the expected workload of a command list (as in, how long it will take), and also to ensure that
		// each

CACHE SYSTEM - Detect multiply reuploads, only cache things which are > 2kb?

NOTE FOR TOMORROW: Need to figure out how to do ToStringView for String and TFixedString.
String needs to be renamed to TString, not sure why this wasn't a thing before.

The string view needs to be clamped to the length of the string
the length needs to be clamped to the offset + count - length 

This also needs to be tested.
